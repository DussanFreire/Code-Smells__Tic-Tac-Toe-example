## ðŸ“œ About
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game coded in C#. The project was intentionally designed with code smells to provide a practical example for refactoring exercises. The current code structure has issues like poor naming conventions, duplicated logic, and improper handling of winning conditions, making it a great candidate for improvement.

## âœ¨ Features

*	2-player game: Players alternate turns using x and *.
*	Basic validation: Prevents moves in already occupied spots.
*	Console-based interface: Played directly in the terminal.
